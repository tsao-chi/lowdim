# relational algebra & higher dimensional algebra

we can do relational algebra in prolog,
by saying along which logic variable
(just like in SQL we join over a key).

This means relational algebra is already a algebra
in which we can product two element along different ways.

We can borrow its syntax in higher dimensional algebra.

- We should do low dimensional algebras first -- 0, 1, 2, 3.

或者应该反过来说，higher dimensional algebra 可以用来作为 logic programming 的类型系统。
to express equivalence between relations.
